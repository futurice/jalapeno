# Installation

## Using a package manager

brew tap futurice/jalapeno
brew install --cask jalapeno
```

```powershell tab={"label":"Winget"}
winget install jalapeno
```

## Updating with package manager

```bash tab={"label":"Homebrew"}
brew update
brew upgrade --cask jalapeno

## From the Binary Releases

Cross-platform binaries are provided with each release of Jalapeno. These can manually be
downloaded and installed from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/futurice/jalapeno/releases/).

In short, the process is:

1. Download [the latest version of Jalapeno](https://github.com/futurice/jalapeno/releases/latest)
   for your platform
2. Extract the archive
3. Make the binary executable
4. Rename and move the binary to the proper location

For example, on macOS (running on Apple Silicon) this can be done with:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/futurice/jalapeno/releases/latest/download/jalapeno-darwin-arm64.tar.gz -o jalapeno.tar.gz
tar -xvf jalapeno.tar.gz
chmod +x jalapeno
mv jalapeno /usr/local/bin/jalapeno
```

## Use via Docker

It is possible to use Jalapeno via Docker without installing it locally. The Jalapeno image is available
from the GitHub Container Registry, and thus the following command on a \*nix system is equivalent
to running `jalapeno` locally:

```bash tab={"label":"macOS and Linux"}
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workdir ghcr.io/futurice/jalapeno:latest
```

```batch tab={"label":"Windows Command Line"}
docker run -it --rm -v %cd%:/workdir ghcr.io/futurice/jalapeno:latest
```

```powershell tab={"label":"PowerShell"}
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/workdir ghcr.io/futurice/jalapeno:latest
```

## Build From Source

First, make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and
[Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation) installed.

Then you can compile the binary with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/futurice/jalapeno.git
cd jalapeno
task build
```

After this, the binary is available on the path `./bin/jalapeno`.

You can also build the binary from source with [`go install`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-install) command:

```bash
go install github.com/futurice/jalapeno/cmd/cli@latest
```

This will install the binary to `$GOPATH/bin` or `$HOME/go/bin` depending on your Go environment.
