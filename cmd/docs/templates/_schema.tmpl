## Recipe schema (`recipe.yml`)

[Source code](https://github.com/futurice/jalapeno/blob/main/pkg/recipe/recipe.go#L7)

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` | `string` | `v1` | Version of the recipe metadata API schema. Currently should have value "v1". |
| `name` | `string` | | Name of the recipe. |
| `version` | `string` | | Version of the recipe. Must be valid [semver](https://semver.org/). |
| `description` | `string` | | Description of what the recipe does |
| `sources` | `[]string` | | A list of URLs to source code for this recipe. |
| `templateExtension` | `string` | | File extension of files in "templates" directory which should be templated. Files not matched by this extension will be copied as-is. If left empty (the default), all files will be templated. |
| `initHelp` | `string` | | A message which will be showed to an user after a succesful recipe execution. Can be used to guide the user what should be done next in the project directory. |
| `ignorePatterns` | `[]string` | | Glob patterns for ignoring generated files from future recipe upgrades. Ignored files will not be regenerated even if their templates change in future versions of the recipe. |
| `vars` | [`[]Variable`](#variable) | | An array of variables which can be used in templates. The user will be prompted to provide the value for the variable if not set with `--set` flag. |

### Variable

[Source code](https://github.com/futurice/jalapeno/blob/main/pkg/recipe/variable.go#L13)

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | | The name of the variable. It is also used as unique identifier, so two variables can not have the same name. |
| `description` | `string` | | Description of the variable. Will be shown to the user when "show help" is activated. |
| `default` | `string` | | Default value of the variable. |
| `confirm` | `bool` | `false` | If set to true, the prompt will be yes/no question, and the value type will be boolean. |
| `optional` | `bool` | `false` | If set to true, the variable can be left empty. |
| `options` | `[]string` | | The user selects the value from a list of options. |
| `validators` | [`[]Validator`](#validator) | | Validators for the variable. |
| `if` | `string` | | Makes the variable conditional based on the result of the expression. The result of the evaluation needs to be a boolean value. Uses https://github.com/antonmedv/expr. |
| `columns` | `[]string` | |  Set the variable as a table type with columns defined by this property. |

### Validator

[Source code](https://github.com/futurice/jalapeno/blob/main/pkg/recipe/variable.go#L50)

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pattern` | `string` | | Regular expression pattern to match the input against. |
| `help` | `string` | | If the regular expression validation fails, this help message will be shown to the user. |
| `column` | `string` | | Apply the validator to a column if the variable type is table. |

## Test schema (`test.yml`)

[Source code](https://github.com/futurice/jalapeno/blob/main/pkg/recipe/test.go#L13)

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `values` | `map[string]any` | | Values to use to render the recipe templates. Map key is the name of the variable and value is the variable value. |
| `ignoreExtraFiles` | `bool` | | If true, test will pass even though templates generated more files than the test specifies. This is useful when creating specific test cases for large recipes. |

## Sauce schema (`sauces.yml`)

[Source code](https://github.com/futurice/jalapeno/blob/main/pkg/recipe/sauce.go#L10)

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` | `string` | `v1` | Version of the sauce API schema. Currently should have value "v1". |
| `recipe` | [`Recipe`](#recipe-schema-recipeyml) | | The recipe which was used to render the sauce. |
| `values` | `map[string]any` | | Values which was used to execute the recipe. |
| `files` | `map[string]File` | | Files genereated from the recipe |
| `id` | `string` | | Random unique ID whose value is determined on first render and stays the same on subsequent re-renders (upgrades) of the sauce. Can be used for example as a seed for template random functions to provide same result on each template. |
| `from` | `string` | | Defines the repository where updates should be checked for the recipe. |
